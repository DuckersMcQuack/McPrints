This is the beginning of my pages to share my workflows and my tuning/discoveries to achieve miniature prints:

1: 3:1 ratio extruder, higher ratio extruder means finer and finer consistent extrusions
2: 4:1 ratio Z elevation, i use belted Z with belted gears, or a 4:1 lead screw, the higher ratio means smaller native layer height increments per physical step. 
3: Optional, but recommended, 2-4:1 geared planetary gearbox for X and Y motors to achieve even finer movements for super tiny perimiters. I've yet to test this out myself, but i desire to buy some as my ender can't do mad speeds anyways due to being a bed slinger, and my LDO motors capable of so much more
