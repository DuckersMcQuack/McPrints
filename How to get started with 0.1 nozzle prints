This is the beginning of my pages to share my workflows and my tuning/discoveries to achieve miniature prints:

1: 3:1 ratio extruder, higher ratio extruder means finer and finer consistent extrusions

2: 4:1 ratio Z elevation, i use belted Z with belted gears, or a 4:1 lead screw, the higher ratio means smaller native layer height increments per physical step. 

3: Optional, but recommended, 2-4:1 geared planetary gearbox for X and Y motors to achieve even finer movements for super tiny perimiters. 
I've yet to test this out myself, but i desire to buy some as my ender can't do mad speeds anyways due to being a bed slinger, and my LDO motors capable of so much more

As the 0.1 nozzle is 16x less volumetric amount of filament coming out, you need to drop speeds significantly.
On a e3d v6 with LGX extruder in directdrive, i use 7mm's at 205c to get the least amount of stringing. Any faster and a clog could be imminent.
